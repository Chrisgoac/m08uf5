        <p>
            The <i>Artemis</i> program is an ongoing crewed spaceflight program carried out by <i>NASA</i>, U.S. commercial spaceflight companies, and international partners such as ESA,[61] with the goal of landing "the first woman and the next man" on the Moon, specifically at the lunar south pole region by 2024. Artemis would be the next step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for private companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to Mars.

            In 2017, the lunar campaign was authorized by Space Policy Directive 1, utilizing various ongoing spacecraft programs such as Orion, the Lunar Gateway, Commercial Lunar Payload Services, and adding an undeveloped crewed lander. The Space Launch System will serve as the primary launch vehicle for Orion, while commercial launch vehicles are planned for use to launch various other elements of the campaign.[62] NASA requested $1.6 billion in additional funding for Artemis for fiscal year 2020,[63] while the Senate Appropriations Committee requested from NASA a five-year budget profile[64] which is needed for evaluation and approval by Congress.
